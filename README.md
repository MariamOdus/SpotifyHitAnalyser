# SpotifyHitAnalyser
Predicting song success through machine learning, audio analysis, and Spotify data.

An end‑to‑end machine learning project that predicts the hit potential of songs using a combination of Spotify audio features, metadata, and engineered ML features.
The system integrates real‑time Spotify API data, multiple ML models (baseline, tree‑based, and neural), interpretability tools, and a Streamlit interface to deliver insights into what makes a song successful.

This project is inspired by real workflows used in music analytics and recommendation systems, combining data science, audio analysis, and product thinking.
